# BetaHealth
 BetaHealth is a technology product that allows users to access their medical records through an in-built API that enables the transfer of medical records from hospitalsâ€™ local databases to a cloud based HER. This project is currently under development and is a spin off from an entry in the Fuel Africa 2022 Challenge.
